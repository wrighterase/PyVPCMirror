# PyVPCMirror
This will clone exising AWS configurations much like Terraform.  Its purpose is to dynamically update a DynamoDB database with updated information about the existing VPC.
Replication to another DynDB region is still required as well writing the code to deploy a clone VPC based off of that information.
